# Stocks-Portfolio
This is a full-stack application to manage stock portfolios. Users can create their own personal portfolios, add/delete stocks and see their current price in the market. To do this, I have implemented a REST API served with Express to perform CRUD operations in PostgreSQL. In this project, I also assembled custom hooks to improve reusability and scalability of functional React components.
